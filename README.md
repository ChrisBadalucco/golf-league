This application is built off AngularJS and Bootstrap. This is an open-source project. Feel free to fork the code and run with the idea!
 
#How to run the application:
You must have Node(npm), Bower, and Grunt installed on your machine. Once those are configured, run npm install followed by bower install.

//TODO - revisit ability to install bower from npm.
